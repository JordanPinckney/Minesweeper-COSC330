# Minesweeper-COSC330

This is the final project for COSC330 at Salisbury University. An app where you can log in and play minesweeper either individually or against an opponent.

# Description

This app allows a user to create an account and log in. They will then be able to select either "Play Solo" or "Play Race". 

### Solo Play

A user will be able to select a level of difficult to play. Once they've selected their level of difficulty the app will generate a board and start the timer. The user will then play a game of minesweeper dependent on the difficulty level. The game will finish when the user has either cleared all the free tiles, or clicked a bomb. Either way, once the game is over the user will navigate back to the home page.

 ### Race Play

 The user will enter the username of the opponent who they would like to challenge to a race and then click the "Start Race" button. Once the button has been pressed the user will wait for the other user to join the race. After that the race will begin, upon completion of the race, the users will be shown either a win or lose screen, they can then navigate back to the home screen or play again.
